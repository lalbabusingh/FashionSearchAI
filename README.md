Project: Fashion Search AI
Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an AI-driven fashion
query response system capable of delivering detailed, user-friendly, and contextually
relevant answers to fashion-related inquiries. By leveraging advanced AI models, the
system aims to enhance the user experience by providing precise and informative
responses, assisting users in discovering fashion items that align with their preferences.
Design:
The project comprises two core layers: the Search Layer and the Generation Layer.
The Search Layer is responsible for retrieving relevant fashion items from the dataset
using keyword matching or predefined criteria, ensuring accurate and efficient filtering
of results. The Generation Layer, on the other hand, leverages advanced AI models
such as GPT-3.5 to produce detailed, context-aware, and natural language responses to
user queries, enhancing the system's ability to deliver informative and engaging
interactions.
Implementation:
The implementation involved several steps, including data preprocessing, model
integration, and query response generation. Data Preprocessing: 

● The CSV dataset was formatted to enhance data quality and readability.
● Blank entries were replaced, decimal points were standardized, and unnecessary
columns were removed.
● Text columns were cleaned to remove HTML tags and extra characters.
Model Integration: ● Advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 were integrated into the system to generate
responses to user queries.
● Queries were passed through the model to generate detailed and contextually
relevant responses.
Query Response Generation: ● User queries were processed by both the search layer and the generation layer.
● The search layer retrieved relevant fashion items from the dataset.
● The generation layer utilized AI models to generate detailed responses to user
queries, incorporating context and generating natural language responses.
